      <p>
        Hello! My name is Nicholas Crockett. I am currently a "Technical Team Member" for Fast Enterprises which is their way of saying I am a full stack developer, backend application administrator, and general techical resource.</p>
      <p>
        I received my B.S. Computer Science from Southwest Baptist University where I graduated with honors. I interned with Sho-Me power based out of Marshfield, MO and after graduating accepted a position with Fast. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I pursue a number of hobbies including but not limited to creative writing, 3d modeling, miniature painting, 3d printing, and board gaming. Anything that will challenge me mentally, really.
