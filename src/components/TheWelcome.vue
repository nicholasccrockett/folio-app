    <p>Hello there! Welcome to my favorite work in progress. This app was built with <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>. I have built the interactive console using typescript. For more information on this project, check out my GitHub repository.<a href="https://github.com/nicholasccrockett/folio-app">here</a>.</p>
    <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>This project is mostly just a fun little test to make a simple little web app and portfolio. It's not perfect but it was fun to make!</p>
